## Description

Discord bot meant for the SPG discord server. This bot will be customized to integrate multiple third-party apis. We want this bot to be a fully community based experience where we will implement features that our community wants. This is still in the alpha stages so we will be spending most of our time testing and experimenting with the prototype for the bot. If you would like to come chat with us in our discord server, please feel free to join us using the link above.
